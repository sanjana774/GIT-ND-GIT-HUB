What problem does a Version Control System solve?
A Version Control System (VCS) allows multiple developers to collaborate, manage changes, track versions, and revert back to previous states efficiently.

Differentiate between Centralized and Distributed VCS.
In a Centralized VCS, the repository is stored at a single server, whereas, in a Distributed VCS like Git, each developer has a full copy of the repository.

What is Git and how is it different from GitHub?
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in code, while GitHub is a platform to host Git repositories online for collaboration.

What is a staging area in Git?
The staging area is a space where changes are added before committing them to the repository, allowing for controlled and organized commits.

What does the .git folder contain?
The .git folder stores all information about the repository, including commit history, branches, tags, and configuration.

What is git branching and command to create new branch and switching from one to another branch?
Git branching allows multiple lines of development.

To create a new branch: git branch <branch-name>

To switch branches: git checkout <branch-name> or git switch <branch-name>

What is the difference between git reset and git reset --hard?
git reset moves the HEAD to a specified commit but keeps changes in the working directory, while git reset --hard removes all changes permanently.

What is a squash merge, and when would you use it?
A squash merge combines multiple commits into one before merging into the main branch, used for keeping the history clean.

Explain the use of git rebase with an example scenario.
Git rebase is used to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit, making the project history linear and clean.
